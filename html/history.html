	<h1>The history of Asians in America and the discrimination they faced</h1></br>
	<p>As word of the gold mine started to spread, many people rushed to California, increasing the immigration to America. Among the people going for the gold rush were Chinese immigrants. Unfortunately, after the rise of Chinese immigrants in the US,
		the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) was enacted. The act made it illegal for Chinese laborers to immigrate to the US for 10 years. Nonlaborers and Chinese people renetering the US had to get a certificate from the Chinese government to immigrate to
		the US, which was a hard task to do as it was difficult to prove they were nonlaborers. Congress disallowed federal and state courts to grant citizenship to Chinese reisidents, but the courts can still deport them. When the act expired, the Geary
		Act started, which required Chinese residents to register and get a certificate of residence or else they would be deported. It also extended the exclusion for 10 years.</p>
	<p>The Hells Canyon Massacre resulted in the deaths of 34 chinese men. Their bodies were mutilated and dumped in a river. Unfortunately, an all-white jury found the perpetrators innocent.</p>
	<p>The popular case of Tape v. Hurley highlighted the barring of education that Asians faced in that period. Tape, a Chinese-American girl, was denied admissions to school because of her race. Her family sued and the Supreme Court ruled in their
		favor.</p>
	<p>The Page Act of 1875 restricted the hiring of people from "Oriental" countries like China and Japan.</p>
	<p>In the Rock Springs Massacre, 28 Chinese people are killed, 15 more injured. They were looted and all the homes were set on fire in the areaâ€™s Chinatown. They are later compensated.</p>
	<p>The Immigration Act of 1917 banned Chinese, Asian Indians, Burmese, Thai, Maylays and other ethinicities.</p>
	<p>In response to the Japan bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese people are forced into internment camps. Most of them lost their belongings.</p>
	<p>"The Scott Act made reentry to the United States after a visit to China impossible, even for long-term legal residents."</p>
	<p>"in 1902, the prohibition was expanded to cover Hawaii and the Philippines"</p>
